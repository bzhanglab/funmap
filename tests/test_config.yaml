# if not, we will use features based on correlation coefficient or mutual rank

# the extra feature should be provided as a tsv file where the first two columns are the gene names
# and the third column is the feature value, it is also possible to have more than one extra feature
# in the same file, the first row is the header, and the first two columns should be named 'gene1' and 'gene2'

# it is also possible to have more than one file.
# funmap will merge all the extra features into one feature matrix and use it for the prediction
# in addition to the correlation coefficient or mutual rank.
